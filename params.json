{"name":"Your Coding Center","tagline":"Learn To Code, Interactively","body":"### Teaching Programmers, Not Just Computer Scientists\r\nJust like writing, coding is a skill that can best be learned from those who already know.  Your Coding Center brings together skilled coding instructors with students who are taking computer science classes.  We serve the same role as a writing center does for students writing papers, providing feedback and tools students can use to improve their code.\r\n\r\nColleges that contract with Your Coding Center prepare their students for the world of professional software development.  Up to this point this kind of mentorship was only available through internships at these top software companies, but now students of all backgrounds can get the same opportunity.","google":"UA-10237658-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
